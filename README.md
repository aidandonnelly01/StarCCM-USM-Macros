# USM Macros for Siemens' Simcenter StarCCM+

Documentation is currently a work in progress, however these macros should give a good idea on how to create and run macros designed 
for use in FSAE aerodynamic simulations

Some adaptation may be required to make these sims work with other team's CAD models, however these macros assume that the sim has 
been meshed and ran correctly, and that the origin point of the car should be between the front two wheels. 

Should be designed to work with half car or full car CAD models

# Running the macro

Download the file ExperterV2.java and run in StarCCM+'s macro suite. No compiler should be nessecary.
